/* Values/ DataTypes
 We can think of these as the "nouns" of javaScript 
 they are bits of data that store information and can be 
 categorized into 4 different types of information*/
    

 
// Operators



// Expressions vs. Statements



// Variables also known as "bindings"



// Functions


/* Data Structures
    These are similar to DataTypes in that they are part of the fundamental building blocks of
    our code, but they are composed of those different building blocks. An array is a list of 
    data types. We can think of it as flat- it lists references to other datatypes. An Object is
    a container of data types that uses key-value pairs. We can think of it as three dimensional.
    An array is like a shopping list, an object is like your shopping cart. */
