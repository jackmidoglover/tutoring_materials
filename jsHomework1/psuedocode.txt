1. Create HTML page that user will interact with. HTML page will contain: 
"Guess what letter I'm thinking of"

"Wins:"
"Losses:"
"Guesses Left:" 
"Your guesses so far:"

2. When the game begins, the computer will choose a random letter

3. When a user presses a key, that key will save to a variable

4. The game will evaluate if the user key equals the letter it choose

5. If the user key matches, the game will increment Wins, and select a new letter, clear other values

6. If the user key does not match, the game will add that key to guesses so far and decrement guesses Left

7. When guesses left = 0 the game will increment Wins
